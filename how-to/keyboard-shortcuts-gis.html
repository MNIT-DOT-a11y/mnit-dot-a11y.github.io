<p>ArcGIS apps mostly rely on standard web keyboard navigation plus a few app‑specific behaviors. Below is a reference you can use when testing published web maps, Dashboards, and StoryMaps.</p>

<h2>When doing keyboard testing on ArcGIS maps, Dashboards, and  StoryMaps:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Navigate the entire experience with keyboard  only, ensuring all interactive elements are reachable, operable, and have  visible focus.</li>
  <li>Check that map interactions (panning, zooming,  opening pop‑ups) and dashboard interactions (filters, selectors)  are fully usable without a mouse.</li>
</ul>

  <tr scope="row">
    <td><span class="keyboard-key">Arrow keys</span></td>
    <td>Move within a focused control (for example, through menu items, tabs, or options)    and, in maps, pan the view depending on the app.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr scope="row">
    <td><span class="keyboard-key">Esc</span></td>
    <td>Close dialogs and menus or return focus from embedded media or maps to surrounding content.</td>
  </tr>

<h2>Published web maps inside apps </h2>
<p>When a web map is embedded in an ArcGIS app (such as in  Dashboards or StoryMaps), test using the core navigation keys to verify:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The map receives focus via Tab (there is a  visible focus ring on the map container or a control).</li>
  <li>All visible map tools (zoom, home, basemap  switcher, legend, etc.) are reachable and operable via Tab/Enter.</li>
</ol>
<h2>ArcGIS Dashboards keyboard testing </h2>
<p>Dashboards support full keyboard navigation through the  layout and individual elements. Test dashboard using the core navigation keys  to verify:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Focus order is logical as you Tab through the  page (top‑to‑bottom, left‑to‑right,  grouping related controls together).</li>
  <li>Every interactive element shows a visible focus  indicator and can be used with Enter/Space.</li>
</ol>
<h2>StoryMaps reading/navigation shortcuts </h2>
<p>For readers of classic Story Map Journal/Series and modern  ArcGIS StoryMaps, keyboard navigation lets you move through the narrative and  media.</p>

  </tr>
  <tr scope="row">
    <td><span class="keyboard-key">Arrow keys</span></td>
    <td>Scroll narrative panels and sometimes move between items depending on block type; they can also be used by screen readers to move within content.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr scope="row">
    <td><span class="keyboard-key">Esc</span></td><td>When focus is inside an image or map in classic Story Map Journal, Esc returns focus to the narrative panel</td>
  </tr>
