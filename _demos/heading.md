## About headings

Headings give the page structure and meaning to the screen reader user and search engines.

Headings are ranked `<h1>` through `<h6>`

`<h1>` represents the most important idea on the page, and sub-sections are organized with `<h2>` level headings. Those sub-sections can be divided with `<h3>` level headings, and so on.

All pages should at least have a `<h1>` level heading giving the page title. On this page Heading: h1, h2, h3 is the `<h1>`

Heading levels should not be skipped to be more specific (for example, do not skip from <h2> to <h5>). It is permissible to skip headings in the other direction if the outline of the page calls for it (for example, from <h5> to <h2>).

## How screen readers use headings

Screen reader users can navigate a page according to its headings, listen to a list of all headings, and skip to a desired heading to begin reading at that point.
