## How to identify interactive buttons

Buttons should be visually distinguishable as interactive elements. This means that users must be able to tell at a glance which elements are clickable or actionable. Ensure that:
- Buttons have a clear, distinct visual style (e.g., raised, with borders).
- Labels or icons used on buttons accurately represent their function (e.g., "Submit" or an icon of a floppy disk for saving).

Check for:
- Visual scan: Check if buttons are easily identifiable on the screen.
- Icons/graphics: Verify the clarity of icon-based buttons.

## How to ensure text alternatives are available for non-text buttons

For buttons with icons instead of text, there must be alternative text to describe the action for assistive technology. This ensures that users relying on screen readers can understand what the button does.

- Use screen readers to ensure that each button is announced properly.
- Focus on the button and verify that its function and state is described audibly by the screen reader.

## Color contrast

Text and icons on buttons must meet appropriate color contrast requirements to be easily readable against their backgrounds. This ensures that people with low vision or color blindness can perceive the button's label or icon.

- Use color contrast analyzers to ensure the contrast ratio meets the minimum 4.5:1 for text and 3:1 for large elements.

## Making sure buttons are easily clickable

Users must be able to activate buttons via clicking with a mouse or tapping on touch devices.

- Use a mouse to click the button and observe if it responds as expected.
- For buttons that support double-click actions, ensure they behave correctly upon double-clicking.
- Ensure the button is sized appropriately for those with motor disabilities that may not be able to control the mouse (no smaller than 44PX)

## Managing focus

When users navigate to a button using a keyboard, there must be a clear visual indication that the button is in focus. This allows users to know which element is currently selected.

1. Press **Tab** to move focus to the button.
2. Verify that a visible outline or other focus indication is clearly displayed.
3. Ensure the focus indication is sufficiently distinct from surrounding elements.

## Clear purpose

Buttons should clearly indicate their function in the context of the application. Users should not have to guess what a button does.

1. Read the button's label or icon.
2. Ensure that the label or icon provides sufficient information about the button's action in the context of the screen or dialog.

## How to Convey the buttonâ€™s semantic role

A button should be properly identified as a button by assistive technologies. This means that the button's role should be conveyed clearly, ensuring compatibility with screen readers and other tools.

- Use a screen reader to navigate to the button and confirm that the button is announced as a button, not as a different element like a link or label.
- If a button has no role at all, this should be considered a WCAG failure. You can often tell if a button has no role by using a screen reader. IF the name is announced but it is not indicated as a button, the user may not know that they are able to interact with it.

## Ensuring that the state is conveyed

For buttons that can be toggled (e.g., a play/pause button), the current state of the button must be clearly conveyed. The user should know whether the button is in an active or inactive state.

- Press the button to toggle its state.
- Ensure that the screen reader or assistive technology announces the state change (e.g., "Pressed" or "Unpressed").

## Developer Notes

### Exposing Accessible Names

- An accessible name is a short, descriptive text string that a screen reader uses to announce a UI element, including buttons. Set the accessible name for buttons so that they have a meaning that is important for understanding the content or interacting with the UI.
- By default, the accessible name of a button is based on the visible text. In cases where a button contains only an image, use [AutomationProperties.Name](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.automation.automationproperties.name) to provide a text-only equivalent of the button's intended action.

### Name length

- As enforced by UI Automation, the accessible name length cannot be greater than 2048 characters. If a string used for automatic accessible name determination exceeds that limit, the accessible name is truncated at that point.
