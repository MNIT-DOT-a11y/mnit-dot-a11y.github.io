<h2>Zoom Recap</h2>
    <h3>1.4.4 Resize Text (Level AA)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Requirement:</strong> Text must be resizable  up to 200% without loss of content or functionality, and without the need for  assistive technology such as screen magnifiers.</li>
      <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Applies to all text,  including controls and labels, except captions and images of text.</li>
      <li><strong>Intent:</strong> Ensures that users with mild  visual impairments can enlarge text for readability without breaking the layout  or losing access to features.</li>
      <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> The content should  not prevent browsers or user agents from scaling text. Responsive design and  flexible layouts are recommended.</li>
      <li><strong>Note:</strong> Above 200% magnification,  users typically rely on assistive technology for zooming, but up to 200% must  be supported natively by the website.</li>
    </ul>
<h3>1.4.10 Reflow (Level AA)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Requirement:</strong> Content must be presented without loss of information or functionality, and without requiring  scrolling in two dimensions (both horizontally and vertically) at:
    <ul>
      <li>A width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels (for vertical scrolling content)</li>
      <li>A height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels (for horizontal scrolling content)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Intent:</strong> Users should be able to zoom  up to 400% (which typically reduces the viewport to 320px wide) and still read  and interact with content by scrolling in only one direction (usually  vertically), not both.</li>
  <li><strong>Exceptions:</strong> Some content that  inherently requires two-dimensional layout (e.g., maps, complex tables,  diagrams, games) is exempt.</li>
  <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Responsive design  techniques, such as CSS media queries, ensure content reflows appropriately as  the viewport size changes.</li>
</ul>
