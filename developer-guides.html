You're right. The issue is that a more general style from your site's main stylesheet is overriding the grid layout.

To fix this, we need to make the CSS rules more specific. By adding an `id` to your list, we can create a powerful selector that will not be overridden. I've also added `!important` as a final guarantee to force the correct display.

Here is the corrected code. This should resolve the issue and give you the three-column layout.

```html
