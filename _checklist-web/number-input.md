## Code examples

### Don't use `type="number"`

The `type="number"` input is intended for **integers** and includes features we _don't_ want (like stepper/scroll functionality) that is a nuisance to everyone 

- Phone, credit card, pin etc. are not integers
- NVDA doesn't fully support `type="number"` inputs at this time

### Use `type="text"` for number inputs

Use `type=text` with `inputmode="numeric"` with an input pattern and JS to filter out non-numeric characters.

{% highlight html %}
{% include /examples/input-text-number.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{::nomarkdown}
<example>
{% include /examples/input-text-number.html %}
</example>
{:/}

### Disabled and focusable number input (preferred)

- Using the `aria-disabled` attribute will allow the input to be focusable and more discoverable

{% highlight html %}
{% include /examples/input-text-number-disabled-focusable.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{::nomarkdown}
<example>
{% include /examples/input-text-number-disabled-focusable.html %}
</example>
{:/}

### Fully disabled number input (avoid)

- Fully `disabled` inputs are not focusable so may not be as discoverable in a form

{% highlight html %}
{% include /examples/input-text-number-disabled.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{::nomarkdown}
<example>
{% include /examples/input-text-number-disabled.html %}
</example>
{:/}

### Telephone number input

- Setting type="tel" changes the keyboard for mobile app users

{% highlight html %}
{% include /examples/input-tel.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{::nomarkdown}
<example>
{% include /examples/input-tel.html %}
</example>
{:/}

## Developer notes

- [Why the GOV.UK Design System team changed the input type for numbers](https://technology.blog.gov.uk/2020/02/24/why-the-gov-uk-design-system-team-changed-the-input-type-for-numbers/)
- [Stepper/counter input example](/checklist-web/stepper-input/)

### Name
- Include `for="input-id` in each `<label>` label to associate it with the input
- Use `aria-label="Input name"` as a last resort if a `<label>` can't be used
- Don't hide the label on focus

### Role
- Identifies as a text input


### Group
- Include `for="input-id` in each `<label>` label to associate it with the input
- Use `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` to name a group of inputs.

### Focus
- Focus must be visible
