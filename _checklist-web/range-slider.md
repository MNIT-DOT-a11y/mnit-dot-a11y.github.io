## Code examples

This is one of the exceedingly rare instances where a custom element makes a lot of sense.

### Use a custom element

- Custom elements are **easier to style reliably** across browsers.
- [Working slider pattern examples](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/slider/)


{% highlight html %}
<div id="range-label">
  How much cowbell?
</div>
<div class="track">
  <div id="thumb"
       role="slider"
       tabindex="0"
       aria-valuemin="0"
       aria-valuenow="10"
       aria-valuemax="11"
       aria-labelledby="range-label">
  </div>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}


### Semantic HTML

While there is a native range input, it is **difficult to style reliably** across browsers.

{% highlight html %}
{% include /examples/input-range.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{::nomarkdown}
<example>
{% include /examples/input-range.html %}
</example>
{:/}
