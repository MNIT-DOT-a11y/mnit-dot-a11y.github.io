## Do not enable/disable buttons based on scrolling container

- Screen readers can read content _without_ changing the scroll offset position in the viewpoint.
- If you use a scrolling container for terms & conditions, **don't disable the continue button** because someone using a screen reader may not be able to enable the button.

## Code examples

{::nomarkdown}
<example>
<div role="region" 
     aria-label="Screenreader browser pairing table"  
     class="scrolling-container" 
     tabindex="0">
     
     {% include /examples/table-screen-reader-browser-pairing.html %}
</div>     
</example>
{:/}

{% highlight html %}
{% include /examples/scrolling-container.html %}
{% endhighlight %}


## Developer notes

### Name
- Use `aria-label="Container purpose"` to give the container a name and purpose.

### Role
- Use `role="region"` to set apart the div as a landmark.

### Focus
- Use `tabindex="0"` to make the container element focusable
- Focus must be visible
