## Code examples

### Adding hint/help text

{% highlight html %}
{% include /examples/input-text.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{::nomarkdown}
<example>
{% include /examples/input-text.html %}
</example>
{:/}

### Adding an error

Note: The alert must be structured as below to function properly in VoiceOver, with the alert text nested inside the `role="alert"` element.

{% highlight html %}
{% include /examples/input-text-error.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{::nomarkdown}
<example>
{% include /examples/input-text-error.html %}
</example>
{:/}

### When there is no hint or alert

Using `aria-describedby` with a uniqueID that doesn't exist on page yet will generate errors in automated syntax checking tools. 

If it's not possible to remove the attribute, there are ways to avoid the error flag.

#### Option 1: Leave `aria-describedby=""` empty until the hint exists (preferred)

This is preferred because the DOM is cleaner.

{% highlight html %}
<label for="favorite-pickle">
  What is your favorite pickle?
</label>
<input type="text"
       id="favorite-pickle"
       aria-describedby="">
       <!-- Leave aria-describedby attribute empty -->
{% endhighlight %}

#### Option 2: Leave the empty hint element in the DOM

This technique shouldn't have any significant side effects, but does leave surplus elements in the DOM which is gross.

{% highlight html %}
<label for="favorite-snack">
  What is your favorite healthy snack?
</label>
<input type="text"
       id="favorite-snack"
       aria-describedby="hint-favorite-snack">
<div class="hint" id="hint-favorite-snack">
  <!-- Leave the hint element empty -->
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

## Developer notes

### Browser + screen reader quirks

- Screenreaders do not implement alerts uniformly and must be tested
  - Just because an alert pattern works in one screen reader doesn't mean it will work in all of them
- The element referenced by the `aria-describedby` attribute cannot use the `role="alert"` attribute (see example above for workaround). 
  - [VoiceOver fails to read a referenced `role="alert"` element when the input is in focus](https://a11ysupport.io/tests/tech__aria__aria-describedby-with-role-alert).
- NVDA will read the alert twice if it appears while the input is in focus: once from the `role="alert"` being injected and from the `aria-describedby` association.
- NVDA needs a fraction of a second to catch up with changes in the DOM, use a `setTimeout` to delay displaying the alert
