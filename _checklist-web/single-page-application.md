## Focus management & consistency

- Focus must be **deliberately and consistently** placed at the
  - top of new page content or 
  - top of the HTML page
- Pick one or the other and **consistently** follow that pattern
- **DO NOT** place focus on the first input on page load

## How does dynamic `aria-live` content work?

- The screen reader expects content **within** an element with a `aria-live="polite"` attribute to change
- By default, **only the content that has changed** will be read
- To force the screen reader to read all contents even if it did not change within the element, add `aria-atomic="true"`
- **Rarely** must you use `aria-live="assertive"` as it will override every other message from the screen reader

## About alerts

- _By default_ an element using `role="alert"` has `aria-live="assertive"`

## Code example

This is one example of a dynamic content region. It is similar to the carousel example.

- It is not the only way to build a dynamic region, but it meets all the critieria:
  - New content is announced
  - Focus is consistently placed at the top of the content
